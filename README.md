# Persona by mynth

Hey! This is a project built for the hackathon. If you're also fascinated about personas, ai, generations etc. you can contribute to this project and help it grow.

Warning! Warning! Warning! Active contributors will get some bigger limits for generations and access to better models in future!!!

Keep in mind, that for now the project is in pretty bad state, as I haven;t got a lot of time, and worked through nights to just make it work, and after some time stopped to pay attention to code style etc. I'll be trying to clean it up and setup some rules, liniting etc. if you want to help me with that, you're more than welcome to do so :)

# Roadmap

- [ ] Add filters and sorting for public personas
- [ ] Add search functionality
- [ ] Improve the homepage
- [ ] Optimize and fix issues
- [ ] Improve pagination
- [ ] Add more options and improve persona prompt creator
- [ ] Allow prompts editing or duplication
- [ ] Add more models for persona generations
- [ ] Add more models for image generations
- [ ] Premium models
- [ ] Add public prompts
- [ ] Add models directory, specifically for personas interations

### Public prompts

Add a possibility to publish persona prompts, like personas currently. Allow users to duplicate public prompts and edit them etc.

### More models

We should add more models and experiment with persona and images creation. Allow users to submit feedback about creations, so we can later compare results with models used.

### Premium models

Add some better models (more expensive hehe) for persona and image generations. We can add some payments, so users can buy tokens and get access to better models.

### Models directory

We should add a directory with models, so users can comment and create guides for different models, designed specifically for personas interactions, like role-play etc.

Here's a great place for Xata ask GPT feature. Based on user comments/feedback/guides about models we could add functionality to ask GPT about models, and get cool responses on how to improve your experience with specific models.
